# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

#Then I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10

#I determined the number of songs listed for each artist, from highest to low
SELECT artist_name, count(track_name) AS songs_per_artist
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY songs_per_artist DESC

#Determined artists who have an average danceability higher than 0.500
SELECT artist_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING AVG(danceability) > 0.500

#Calculate the average popularity for each artist, then, for every artist with average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, popularity and label them as "Top Star"
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS(
SELECT s.artist_name, AVG(s.popularity) as average_popularity
FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY s.artist_name)
SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90
